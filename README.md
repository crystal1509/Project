# Project
This project is created by GANGA SINGH.
This game i created is guess the number in which user interacts with the computer to play.
!!WORKING!!
  The computer selects any random number between 2 bounds (upper and lower) which is inputed by the user
  So now user have only 10 chances to guess that number
  it will display the difficulty of the game as well according to the upper bound entered.
  Once you have guessed the number it displays the number of chances it get to solve this game.
  You can play this game as much as you want!!
  THANK YOU!!
